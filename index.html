        This chart is motivated by the state's guidance that counties "having fewer than 50 new confirmed cases per 100,000 population reported to the department in the previous 14 days" will be able to begin the return to normal lifestyle.

      <p>Montogomery County has now claimed the lives of 288 residents in nursing and personal care homes. There are 60 Nusring facilities in Montogmery County with a total of 7172 beds for patients. If we assume all facilities were at max capacity when Coronavirus broke out, that would mean that Coronavirus has claimed the lives of 4% of all residents. In the state there were 80,000 Pennsylvanians in nursing homes, and Coronavirus has now taken the lives of 1,560 of those residents (1.95% of nursing home residents). Nursing home deaths now accoutn for 66% of the total death count in Pennsylvania. What can we do to help those working/living in Nursing homes? Should some of the focus on Hospitals shift to these 700 homes?

      <p>5,795 tests reported today. 1,102 were positive. 479 deaths were reported today. Death total is now 2,195 in the state. A big spike in total deaths, but it may be due to assisted living homes catching up in reporting. The % of total deaths coming from assisted living home residents continues to climb in the state (65% now). There have been 1,702 and 4,538 postive cases in Montgomery and Philadelphia County, respectively in the last 14 days. Goal counts for these counties to move into the next reopening phase are 414 and 792. The state has now tested 214,000 people (1.7% of the population). 79%% of all conducted tests were negative.</p>

Montgomery County has the second highest number of confirmed positive cases in the state by county, but it ranks 8th in % of county infected. Monroe county ranks first with 0.48% of their population testing positive. It is early to say, but this may be the beginning of seeing how county wealth affects spread. Montgomery County ranks 2nd in the state in per capita income, while Monroe county ranks 21st.

      <p>Repeating from yesterday because I think it is important:
      A month into wide spread testing in the state, it seems as though the number of tests adminisitered is less important. Medical professionals seem to have a good understanding of the symptoms associated with Covid-19. For many patients there is no need to test, and a greater need to understand severity and treatment. The number of positive cases reported will continue to serve as an estimate to how the virus is spreading, but only if the number of tests per day stays somewhat consistent.</p>

      <p>6083 tests reported in PA today. 1470 positive. 12 deaths were reported today. Philadelphia County reported 32% of the positive cases in the last 24 hours. Both Luzerne and Lehigh county reported 9% of the postive cases today. Throughout my 16 days of tracking, Montogomery and Philadelphia county have been the leaders in total positive cases. This is still the case, but the number of cases in Lehigh County is increasing rapidly. There are now over 1000 cases in Lehigh County, the third highest in the state. I am wondering why this could be. Lehigh County only has a population of 300k. Could be many reasons, but it is interesting to note that Lehigh county is home to the 3rd largest hospital, Lehigh Valley Hospital, by number of hospital beds. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_hospitals_in_Pennsylvania">(SOURCE)</a>  It is possible and important to note that the state is reporting cases not by permanent residence, but rather by site of positive test. </p>

As this unfolds, it may not be a question of how to stop the spread of Covid in the state, but rather how to isolate/identify those infected in Philadelphia.</p>

The growth rate is climbing, and the number of positive cases has now reached 10,000. It's very difficult to understand how much of this is due to increased reporting/testing vs actual daily spread. In a lot of ways, we may be hearing about last week today. If that is the case, the social distancing measures we take this weekend will shine in the reports next weekend.</p>

Now the state has 37k confirmed cases. There is plenty of room for growth within PA, and with it good reason to continue quarantine. Philadelphia and Montgomery County continue to report the most positive cases with 128 and 92, respectively. Interesting new stats: 40% of positive cases in PA are among adults 25-49. 48% of hospitalizations in PA are among adults 65+. PA has started to release stats on age breakdowns.

Philadelphia and Montgomery County continue to report the most positive cases with 145 and 110, respectively. Unfortunately, there is not information being provided on how many tests each county is conducting. This would let us know the number of negatives by county, and better inform the us of the concentration of the virus.</p>

      <p>As I am quarantined in PA, I have been tracking the development of COVID-19 in the state. All data is pulled from <a href="https://www.health.pa.gov/topics/disease/coronavirus/Pages/Cases.aspx">health.pa.gov</a> on a daily basis. All opinions are my own. This website is mainly to serve as a place for organzing findings and data.</p>
